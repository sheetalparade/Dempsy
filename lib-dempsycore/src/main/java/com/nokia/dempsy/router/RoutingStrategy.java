/**
 * <p>A {@link RoutingStrategy} is responsible for determining how to find the appropriate
 * Node within a given cluster given a {@link MessageKey}. It has both an {@link Inbound}
 * side and an {@link Outbound} side that work together using the {@link MpCluster} to
 * do the bookkeeping necessary.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A simple example would be: a non-elastic, fixed-width cluster {@link RoutingStrategy} that
 * simply selects the Node to send a message to based on the <code>mod ('%' operator) of the hash
 * of a message's key with the number of nodes in the cluster.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In this example the {@link Inbound} strategy, which would be instantiated in each node,
 * would be implemented to register the its current Node with the {@link MpCluster}. The {@link Outbound}
 * side would use the registered information to select the appropriate Node.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>As mentioned, RoutingStrategy implementations need to be balanced. The {@link Inbound} can
 * safely assume that the {@link Outbound} created from the same strategy was responsible for 
 * setting up the cluster.</p>
 * 
 * <p>{@link Inbound} and {@link Outbound} need to be thought of in terms of the stages of a
 * pipeline in a Dempsy application. E.g.: 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * Adaptor --> inbound1|Stage1|outbound2 --> inbound2|Stage2|outbound3 ...
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Notice that <code>outbound2</code> and <code>inbound2</code> require coordination
 * and are therefore defined in the {@link ApplicationDefinition} using a single {@link RoutingStrategy} as
 * part of the {@link ClusterDefinition} that defines <code>Stage2</code>
 * 
 * <p>As an example, the DecentralizedRoutingStrategy's Inbound and Outbound coordinate
 * through the cluster. The Inbound side negotiates for slot ownership and those
 * slots contain enough information for the Outbound side </p>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations must be able to handle multi-threaded access.</p>
